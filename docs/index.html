Another feature of the use of DVCS systems like git is the ability to perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses on the repository. For example, if one were to take stock of all the words used in every document in the SPTH6155 Acelerating Technicity repository, one could then generate a word cloud to visualize the contrast between most common and least common words found:

		
<img src="wordcloud.jpg" alt="word cloud" >

A reading of distributed version control through accelerationism.

This paper concerns the positionality of a distributed cognition as it relates to self-interest in a technicity of open-source collaborative creation/writing/production. Motivations for working in open source. 

A technicity of self-interest in distributed version control projects

<p>
<h3>section: open source collaboration</h3>

<h3>The concernful approach of a repository</h3>




were one to apply this flow of the becoming of material objects to the peer-to-peer interactions in a distributed version control social network. 

To schematize the process for how a thing goes from being considered as an idle standing reserve to becoming something put to use, Heidegger conceived of a circuit of ordering, where in a

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...chain of requisitioning...the standing reserve persists. It persists insofar as it is imposed upon for a requisitioning. Directed into requisitioning, it is placed into application. Application positions everything in advance in such a manner that what is positioned follows upon a result. (Heidegger 25)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

It is important to emphasize in this quote that it is through application that a thing becomes standing reserve. It is first conceived of as a resource, then made to be that resource. A thing's becoming unfolds from its beginning as a different standing reserve through the processes that see it reach its application that requisistioned it from another standing reserve in the first place. Heidegger called this process "...to position, place, set" (26)  

<p>
Following the notion that beyond its common associations with that of its material structure and use, technology is also a way of thinking. Heidegger depicts international relations as a a technology, (CITATION) and it is through the concepts of requisition and conscription that Heidegger would depict the open-source situation as itself a technology. The concernful approach depicts a thing's position in relation to oneself and in relation to other things also all positioned in relation to oneself. With the concernful approach, the concerning creates, in the mind of a human, a mental model of a thing's position in space and time in relation to their self.  

<p>
Integrating a cloud-based productivity platform like Dropbox, Google Docs, and git affords those separated by geographical distance the ability to collaborate on the same project. The mind(s) and potentialities of one's collaborator(s) concernfully approach as nearer in space in this paradigm of distributed creativity. Through the act of logging on to one of these platforms and opening a document previously worked on by any other member of the group, the work is requisitioned and concernfully approaches nearer. In the case of Google Docs, opening on a shared document requisitions its idle, representative data as standing reserve from its home in the cloud server. This data travels from the server to the user's computer, and is assmbled in the client browser as the most-recent version of the shared document. In the sequence of opening a shared document in a browser involves the movement of data in space and time. Whether a user conceptualizes the bi-directional dataflow trajectories between client and server as one of both space and time is another matter, for as the data takes time to travel from the server to the browser, the physical relationship between the user and their computer does not change. Whatever changes in the on-screen activity that results from the point in time when a user clicks to open a shared document, to the successful loading of said document, could be said to be experienced by a user as a temporally-dominant concernful approach. 
<p>
Heidegger's example of the carpenter producing a table depicts a thing concernfully approaching in time. (25) That is, it does not approach in distance, but through its fabrication it approaches in time: from standing reserve -- raw materials, such as treated lumber, sitting idle in the carpenter's workshop; to requisitioning, such as its characteristic positioning as a table, and conscription of the raw materials into position; to its application as a table. A human living in the age of the internet may experience the concernful approach of networked data primarily -- if not totally -- in the temporal domain, as it is normalized through many common instances of internet usage, such as page loading, or downloading or uploading content. 
<p>
When making a pull request, where the latest diffs in the remote repository travel over a network connection from the cloud to the local hard disk. In this action, the diffs concernfully approach the user, and is experienced solely as a movement in the temporal domain. Following, for example, a push command, the terminal provides metric feedback about the progress of the operation in terms of percentage, but not in the spatial domain, as there is no detail provided relating to the physical distance(s) travelled by the data. Time is in this situation a technological embodiment. The user <i>waits</i> for the diffs to be transferred. 
<p>
As the master record of a contemporaneous accounting of the development of a work, performed by one or many collaborators, the remote repository persists in the cloud. It maintains its longinquity (Heidegger 23) in relation to the local repository(s) and the humans that clone, push, and pull its contents. 





Certainly there are some examples of direct ordering between a vertical hierarchy of users, as is the case of [[the Linux kernel, with Linus Torvalds as the superior, mandating what the lieutenants and below are to work on...]]

As per positionality as the "...self-ordering" (31) of standing reserves, the distributed version control system in a social network exhibits patterns of decentralized coordinated behaviour. 

The concept of position, set, place can be used to schematize a distributed version control workflow. Heidegger uses the example of a peasant positioning an ox, not simply so that it is positioned in space, but that it is positioned in space for a specific purpose and use in an action. (26) This logic can also be observed in the case of DVCS. When cloning a repository, a user conscripts the remote repository from standing reserve, applying it as a starting position for their own work going forward. Conversely, the act of pushing a change(s) to a remote repository, in the cloud, is an act of positioning the new state of the repository as a standing reserve. 

<p>
As Github.com is a social network, any user may gain access to any other user's public respositories. Should they wish to copy a repository -- an action called <i>cloning</i> -- they may do so freely. 

"One positioning challenges another, falls upon it with a conscripting. 
This does not proceed by a mere sequence of acts of positioining. 
According to its essence, conscription occurrs in secret and in advance.
 Only for this reason does conscription make possible the planning and 
taking of action upon the individual motives of the particular positionings in a useful manner. But now where does this chain of requisitioning finally run off to?" 

The act of cloning a repository is an acquisition of another person's progress towards expressing an idea, including the contemporaneous accounting of the author's sentiments about the work. In the open-source situation, one is not required to fulfill the desires of the originating author, for one may choose to modify the contents of the cloned repository such that it becomes standing reserve for an all new application. Thus, The process of using someone else's repository is an act of enframing it. 


 the cloned repository as the starting point 



using another's repository to fulfill the desires of its original author. Rather, 




By cloning a repository, one acquires not only a work-in-progress of the means to express an idea, but also a partial or full history of its author's attempts at developing it. 


required to continue the work of another in the attempt to express 

in their work

Application, according to Heidegger, presupposes a thing's positioning. (25) However, in cases where one cannot predetermine how a thing's observer will enframe it -- or in the Github social network, where one cannot predetermine how a repository's potential forker or cloner will enframe it -- its application cannot itself always be accurately predicted. 

The repository as standing reserve will persist -- barring any actions by the user or Github management that would see the repository removed, either willful removal, breach of service contract, or closing of the account, of course.





<h3>section: describe distributed version control</h3>



<p>
<h3>section: argue for self-interest as pro-accelerationist</h3>

<p>
According to Hiedegger, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The principle of individualism, the pursuit of self-interest, was conditioned upon the proposition that self-interest was rational, that is to say, that it resulted from and was constantly guided and controlled by autonomous thinking. The rational self-interest did not coincide with the individual's immediate self-interest, for the latter depended upon the standards and requirements of the prevailing social order, placed there not by his autonomous thought and conscience but by external authorities. (140)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

[scholar ___] show that while altruism and [what else] are common factors that motivate programmers to participate in open-source development of code, 
 an "immediate self-interest" (ibid) of individualism is a driving force inherent to the participation within an open-access social network of ideas and work.




<p>
Users may opt-in to a paid service, offered by the company, that allots a certain number of private repositories, depending on their chosen subscription. While this shows that Github does not mandate that its users expose their work and thoughts to the commons via public repositories, that privacy is the single greatest difference between free and paid accounts suggests that the "...prevailing social order" (Heidegger, page) of Github prefers users engage in open and transparent participation in its social network. But while it may be tempting at first to enframe such a participation as selfless, or perhaprs altruistic, in the act of exposing one's work to peer review, modification, and reification, one not motivated solely by something other than self-interest. The oft-touted idea of "...share early [and] often," (Priem 2013) which forces a creator to push their work into the space(s) of other coginitive and productive millieu(s). As a work ethic, though while interdependent, it is also motivated by self-interests. In the way that positionality links everything as standing reserve, self-interest may be enframed as an ordering (Heidegger, page) of human, artefact, and human-artefact, suggesting that rather than hinder acceleration, individual self-interest relies on and contributes to the efforts and effects of accelerationism. 



<p>
idea of the individual as a resource, page 151 of 'Some Social implications of modern technology' is crucial to this: introduces the shaping of a person into a personality with traits and skills suitable for the completion of certain pre-arranged tasks. This discussion around the intent towards a refinement of a personality or thing as the requisitioning and development of traits and skills can be traced through to the accelerationists, in Reed, with the tenet of abstractify:

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>
	As Mateo Pasquinneli has shown, this power of abstraction is an inherent capacity of the organism (including the human brain) to 
invent new norms in relation to dynamic surroundings, recalling 
that a norm is not law, but a conception of law. (Reed 535-536)

Private repositories are available to users that  the social network as a system has several aspects [reword] in place that encourage this activity.

<p>

	-- However: you can possibly challenge this through Said's Travelling theory: one's vcs project, its impossible to predict who will clone one's given repository, and further to predict how it will be interpreted (linguistically, performatively, computationally?, etc?-- likely, yes!), used, modified, broken, etc. but in this way, crucially and possibly in opposition to Marcuse/Heidegger's fears, the individual (user)'s self-interest' IS a standing reserve to another individual user's self-interest. 

	<p>By offering code as a public repository, you offer it, and your future revisions and interactions as standing reserve. when someone forks/clones [be clear and use distinctions of these two to write different threads of thought], they [and their work] also become standing reserves to you, your work, and also to the rest of the github social network. 

	<p>"Where the daily social performance of the individual 
has become antagonistic to his 'true interest', the 
individualist principle has changed its meaning. The 
protagonists of individualism were aware of the fact that 
'individuals can be developed only by being trusted with 
somewhat more than they can, at the moment, do well'; 
today, the individual is trusted with precisely what 
[they] can, at the moment, do well." [what page is this on??] 
>>but this was written before help forums like stack overflow, or subreddits for how-to help -- how can one think critically about the individual, defined as being trusted with more than what they can do at a given moment: suggests that the individual is a worker who learns on the job? does it also suggest that the individual asks for help/ is helped? 
<p>	- what can be asked about the 'performance of the individual'?
